Project Overview
In this project, I worked on predicting customer booking behavior for British Airways by leveraging data and predictive models. The goal was to proactively acquire customers before they arrived at the airport by analyzing customer booking data and building a machine learning model to forecast their likelihood of making a purchase. The tasks involved dataset exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, followed by the presentation of insights to key stakeholders.

Tasks Completed:
Dataset Exploration and Preparation:

Explored the provided customer booking dataset using Python to understand its structure, basic statistics, and key features.
Performed data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Engineered new features to improve model performance and enhance predictive capabilities, including deriving important attributes related to customer behavior.
Model Training:

Trained a predictive model using a RandomForest algorithm, focusing on the target outcome: whether a customer would make a booking.
Chose RandomForest for its ability to provide insights into feature importance, helping identify which variables had the most significant impact on predictions.
Model Evaluation and Interpretation:

Conducted cross-validation to assess model performance and ensure robustness.
Evaluated the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score to measure predictive success.
Visualized feature importance to interpret the contribution of each variable in the model's predictions.
Presentation of Findings:

Summarized key insights and model performance in a PowerPoint slide, highlighting how customer data can be leveraged for predictive accuracy.
Provided a clear visual breakdown of variable importance, helping stakeholders understand the most influential factors in booking predictions.
All tasks were completed using Python, with visualizations and insights effectively communicated for decision-making. The final deliverable was a presentation slide, summarizing the predictive power of the model and key recommendations based on the findings.
